This file used to track current jobs and their completion.
Most of the job need to be done is described inside source files.
Just use 'Task control' feature of Eclipse, and you'll see :)

Already assigned tasks are listed in JOBS.

More 'global' or just not-started-yet tasks are here (not sorted):

-> Fill in some short info into README.md

-> Add zlib compression to DataPipe

-> Add vehicle class (mountable actors??)

-> Add "distant landscape" right after DataPipe will be capable of saving/loading

-> Implement some command processor and connect it to world's event pump

-> Add auto register function of GUI controls to GUI windows (?)

-> Consider adding lens flare effect for post-processor

-> Create a tree generator

-> Start working on audio system (ALSA PCM output)

-> Move map tiles color information to INI

-> Consider adding callback functions for buttons (??)

-> Move to GNU Autotools. This will cause a lot of work on implementing different use-cases. Most notably, misconsts.h should die.

-> Consider movement of raycasting calculations from LVR to DataPipe to speed up model intersection testing.

-> Draw some simple buildings (one or two stories)

-> Draw building blocks (single floor) for making large buildings

-> Add generation algorithm to create large buildings out of small blocks

-> Add simple "chip"-based AI and add actors ability to move (without pathfinding)

-> Implement world pause mode (physics, animations, game clock and rendering are suspended)

-> Add 'Field' algorithm from a 'minor_2d' test into vecmisc module
